Another project down and this one did not go down easily. To be honest I was very intimidated when starting this exercise and 
was not entirely sure if I would be able to complete it, but after getting over a hang up on problem three I was able to "relatively" 
breeze through the last four problems. What is difficult is first deciding exactly what you need to do, and then to be able 
to program it. You cannot be certain you are calculating the correct answer before you begin coding, at which point your code could
be what is wrong. That is to say that there are a lot of factors working against you, but fortunately we have help in the form 
of notes and classmates and teachers. 

Conceptually speaking, I feel more comfortable now working with these mathematical equations in Python. I mentioned earlier this week in an 
exit ticket that I had felt the need to get back to coding more often so this was a good project to put the skills back into practice. The 
maximum likelihood graph we created was particularly challenging from a programming perspective. To conclude, this was a tough project, but a
necessary one in order to get my hands dirty with some of the material from the past few weeks.
