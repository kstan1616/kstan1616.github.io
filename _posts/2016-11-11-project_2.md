This was a challenging assignment because of the ambiguity of what was being asked 
but I really enjoyed many of the aspects of the project. I think the best way to describe
the sensation is that it was similar to trying to solve a riddle, although the answer 
could be achieved in many different ways. In certain ways it was easier not to ask my 
classmates about certain issues because their manner of solving the was entirely different 
than mine. I have seen a handful of unique decisions, some extremely intricate and other
clean and basic. Mine probably falls somewhere in between the two; it has a few features
that I think could be written in a more concise manner, but in my opinion the code is
simple to follow and functional (I hope), which I guess is the what matters. 

The process of creating this program was long and involved quite a bit of escapes to 
Google in order to research syntax, functions, etc. I initially spent a good hour reading the
the prompt and organizing the architecture of this program, after which I dove directly into the 
code. For the most part my earlier practice in Python served me well, as I was able to immediately
start returning output from my classes. However, on Monday night I decided that I had reached
a dead end and might need to start over. I saved this initial "draft", opened up a new file, and
started a new program from scratch. This proved to be a great strategy as after a few minutes
I had a sort of epiphany. Following my new strategy, and using some of the code I had from before,
I was able to present to my instructors a program which I believe is viable and understandable.

Overall, this project was a great experience and I look forward to the next challenge thrown at me!

Cheers,
