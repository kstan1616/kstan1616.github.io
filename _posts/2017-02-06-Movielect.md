Movielect is a movie recommendation algorithm that aides users in their search for a movie to watch. The user simply indicates the streaming services (ie. Netflix, Hulu) he/she has subscriptions to and a movie to watch. Movielect then suggests a movie and indicates on which of the accessible websites it can be found. The recommendation will be the exact movie, if it is part of the content available, or in most cases, the most similar film based on variety of features.
